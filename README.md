# l4d_reverse_ff

Reverse Friendly-Fire plugin (l4d_reverse_ff) by Mystik Spiral

This plugin reverses all friendly-fire... the attacker takes all of the damage and the victim takes none.
This forces players to be more precise with their shots... or they will spend a lot of time on the ground.
This also discourages griefers/team killers since they can only damage themselves and no one else.

This plugin reverses damage from the grenade launcher, but does not otherwise reverse bomb/explosion damage.
This plugin does not reverse molotov/fire damage and I do not intend to add it.
Players with the generic admin flag will not have friendly-fire reversed or do damage to teammates.
