#### Reverse Friendly-Fire (l4d_reverse_ff) by Mystik Spiral

This plugin reverses friendly-fire... the attacker takes all of the damage and the victim takes none.  This forces players to be more precise with their shots... or they will spend a lot of time on the ground and waiting for respawn closets.

Although this plugin discourages griefers/team killers since they can only damage themselves and no one else, the first objective is to force players to improve their shooting tatics and aim.  The second objective is to encourage new/inexperienced players to only join servers that match their skillset, rather than trying to play at a difficulty above their ability.  Before this plugin, beginners had no penalty for constantly incapping their teammates because they are playing on a difficulty way above their skill level.

This plugin reverses damage from the grenade launcher, but does not otherwise reverse explosion damage.  This plugin does not reverse molotov/gascan damage and I do not intend to add it, though I may make a separate plugin to handle molotov/gascan damage.

- Option to specify extra damage if attacker is using explosive/incendiary ammo. (default=12.5%)
- Option to not reverse friendly-fire when attacker is an admin. (default)
- Option to not reverse friendly-fire when victim is a bot. (default)
